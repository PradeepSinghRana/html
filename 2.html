        <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a 2017 online multiplayer battle royale game develo
            ped and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is bas
            ed on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Jap
            lm Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one 
            hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding ge
            tting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviv
            ing players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.
