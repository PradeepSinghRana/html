        <p>PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is a 2017 online multiplayer battle royale game develo
            ped and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. The game is bas
            ed on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, inspired by the 2000 Jap
            lm Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. In the game, up to one 
            hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding ge
            tting killed themselves. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviv
            ing players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.

                <pre>Battlegrounds was first released for Microsoft Windows via Steam's early access b
                eta program in March 2017, with a full release on December 20, 2017. That same month, the game was 
                released by Microsoft Studios for the Xbox One via its Xbox Game Preview program, and officially released
                 in September 2018. The same year, a free-to-play mobile version for Android and iOS was released, in 
                 addition to a port for the PlayStation 4. The game is one of the best-selling video games of all time,</pre>
                 selling over fifty million copies worldwide by June 2018. In addition, when including its free-to-play
                  mobile version, the game has over 400 million total players, which also makes it one of the most-played 
                  video games overall.</p></br></br>
